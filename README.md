# NASDAQ-parser

This project began with a task from my professor to develop a parser for the data files of the NASDAQ exchange. This exchange uses a special binary format to store and manage a huge amount of data. I wrote a parser that reads multi-gigabyte files which contain information about financial transactions and shows them in a readable format. The parser was implemented as a Java application. 

Then I made the parser a Spring Boot application to learn Java web applications. It used Spring Boot Server as a web container.

In the web version the parser displays data in the form of a web page. I ran the Spring Boot application locally and also deployed it on the Google Cloud Platform. I wrote a post on my blog about that - https://ahmedtanveer.com/blog/blog-post-1/
